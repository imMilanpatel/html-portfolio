        OpreX Robot Management Core is a key product in the Yokogawa robot operations solution. 
        By integrating the management of various types of robots that perform plant maintenance 
        tasks conventionally carried out by humans, this software will help customers maintain 
        their facilities in a safer and more efficient manner. In addition, when connected to a 
        plant control and safety systems, it enables the utilization of manufacturing site data 
        that has been acquired by robots, and the issuing of procedural instructions to robots, 
        thus enabling the first step to be taken toward autonomous plant operations.
